# Plugin Manager

This library provides unified interface for opinionated service building using different service containers. 
It is meant to be a replacement for [plugin manager functionality](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-servicemanager/plugin-managers/) from [`lamanas/laminas-servicemanager`](https://packagist.org/packages/laminas/laminas-servicemanager) if you have to use another service container. 

## Enjoy!
I really hope that this library will be useful for someone except me.
It is used for production purposes but it lacks lots of refinement, especially in terms of tests and documentation.

If you have any suggestions, advices, questions or fixes feel free to submit [issue](https://github.com/Articus/PluginManager/issues/new) or [pull request](https://github.com/Articus/PluginManager/compare).
